# randomizer
# AUTHOR: Aidan Stoeffler
# Description:
A simple random number generator that can generate a specified amount of random numbers within a selected range. These random numbers can either be unique or not, depending on the user's specifications. A Bash script that provides a clean user interface is also provided, and it is recommended to use the randomizer by calling the randomGen.sh Bash script. 

# DEPENDENCIES:
